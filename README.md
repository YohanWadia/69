# Step 1
<pre>
We need a simple for loop 
whose start and end points have been determined by the video
and inside it we are going to save the square & cube of the number to 2 separate ints

for(int i = the starting number; i< the ending number; i increment by 1 ) {

int sq = the square of the number  <b>i</b> is atm
int cube = the cube of the number  <b>i</b> is atm

}
