# Step 2
<h2>Number Concatenation</h2>
<pre>
After getting the number we are on(atm in the for loop via <b>i</b>) we have saved its square and cube to 2 separate int variables.

Now we need to join them.. ie concatenate them. And in doing so we will observe all the digits 0123456789. Please note there can be no repeat of a digit... if there is a digit that repeats for eg 012344456789 .. it not a solution.
There has to be exactly 1 of each digit.
